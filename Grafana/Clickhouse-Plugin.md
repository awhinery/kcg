#Using the Clickhouse Plugin for Grafana

**Note** - There is a Clickhouse Data Source Plugin available from the Grafana repository. You may see many references to a Git-Hosted Altinity plugin, which is the predescessor.
You want the one from the Grafana website: https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-clickhouse-datasource/

Because of the oddness of the IP address columns, you will get almost nothing done in this KCG context with the Grafana query builder in the web interface.

All of the queries I have developed have been SQL queries constructed in the Grafana GUI SQL query editor.
